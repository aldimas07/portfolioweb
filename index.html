          <h2>Short Story About Me!</h2>
          <p>Hi, everyone! Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Aldimas Jaya Dinaga Nugraha Putra, you could call me Dimas and here is my short story about myself!</p>
          <p>
            I'm a 3rd years student and majoring in Informatics Engineering at STIKI Malang. Currently I studying Cloud Computing Path at Bangkit Academy 2023. I'd like to learn about Backend Web Development and DevOps. The programming
            language that I've learn is Go Programming language to create REST API, I also learn JavaScript on Bangkit Academy to build API.

          <h2>My Fixed Mindset</h2>
          <p>My fixed mindset and the reason why I wrote that:</p>
          <h3>I don't like to debate or argue</h3>
          <p>- I prefer transquility (When people are arguing in a forum and things get heated, I think this is bad)</p>
          <p>- I am afraid of hurting people (When expressing opinions or denying someone's arguments in a meeting, it will hurt that person's heart)</p>
          <p>- I think I'd better keep silent (When other people argue and their arguments look good, I guess I'll just have to sit back and watch)</p>
          <p>
            - Opinions in my head sometimes cannot be conveyed properly or in line with what I say (I sometimes take too long to compose the words that I will say from my mind, so that when I speak my words are sometimes different from what
            I thought before)
          </p>
          <h3>I don't like talking in front of the public</h3>
          <p>- I lack self-confidence I feel the audience who listens are people who are smarter than me</p>
          <p>- I am a stiff person I don't know how to bring a pleasant atmosphere</p>
          <p>- I often get nervous when I speak When speaking, I often lose sight of what I'm talking about</p>
          <p>- I am afraid that my words will get out of control I am afraid that if I speak intentionally or unintentionally, consciously or not, I may offend certain parties</p>
          <p>- When I speak, I am afraid that I will not be as cool as other students I saw that other students were better at choosing words and presenting the atmosphere</p>

          <h2>Challenge to change from fixed mindset to growth mindset:</h2>
          <p>
            1. I don't like debate or argue: Debating doesn't always end in conflict, to fight for what you think is right with the support of reference sources and logical reasons is not a problem but by practicing continuously to convey
            and refute arguments, debating for a long time is not be a daunting thing, but to arrive at a solution that works for all parties involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. I don't like to talk in front of the public: I have to master the material that I convey when I will speak in public. What I can do is look for references on the topic to be discussed, divide it into small parts about the
            points I will convey so I don't forget, and try to practice speaking alone in front of the mirror. By doing this, I think the results will certainly be better.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. I can't be disciplined to wake up in the morning: I have to have a target every day to end all activities before 11 pm. I can start exercising regularly so that at night I can go to sleep soon. Besides that, I will also try
            not to use gadgets 1 hour before going to bed.
